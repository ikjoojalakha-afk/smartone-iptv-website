We recognized that traditional cable and satellite services were expensive, inflexible, and often lacked the content diversity that modern viewers demanded.\n\nWhat started as a small team of technology enthusiasts has grown into a leading IPTV provider serving over 50,000 customers across 100+ countries. Our success is built on three pillars: cutting-edge technology, exceptional customer service, and an unwavering commitment to quality.\n\nToday, we're proud to offer the most comprehensive IPTV service in the market, featuring 10,000+ live channels, 50,000+ on-demand titles, and streaming quality up to 4K. But our journey doesn't stop here. We're constantly innovating and expanding to bring you the best possible viewing experience.","color":"#666666","font_size":"18px","line_height":"1.8"}}]},{"id":"timeline_section","type":"section","settings":{"background_color":"#FFFFFF","padding":"60px 20px"},"elements":[{"id":"timeline_heading","type":"heading","settings":{"text":"Our Journey","tag":"h2","color":"#1A1A2E","font_size":"36px","text_align":"center"}},{"id":"milestone_2020","type":"timeline-item","settings":{"year":"2020","title":"Company Founded","description":"Smart One IPTV launches with 1,000 channels and a vision to revolutionize TV streaming","icon":"üöÄ","color":"#FF6B35"}},{"id":"milestone_2021","type":"timeline-item","settings":{"year":"2021","title":"10,000 Customers","description":"Reached our first major milestone with 10,000 satisfied subscribers","icon":"üë•","color":"#00D9FF"}},{"id":"milestone_2022","type":"timeline-item","settings":{"year":"2022","title":"International Expansion","description":"Expanded service to 50+ countries with dedicated international channels","icon":"üåç","color":"#27AE60"}},{"id":"milestone_2023","type":"timeline-item","settings":{"year":"2023","title":"4K Streaming Launch","description":"Introduced 4K Ultra HD streaming on 1,000+ premium channels","icon":"üì∫","color":"#9B59B6"}},{"id":"milestone_2024","type":"timeline-item","settings":{"year":"2024","title":"50,000+ Subscribers","description":"Surpassed 50,000 active subscribers and 10,000 channels milestone","icon":"üèÜ","color":"#F39C12"}}]},{"id":"mission_vision","type":"section","settings":{"background_color":"#F5F5F5","padding":"60px 20px"},"elements":[{"id":"mission_box","type":"icon-box","settings":{"icon":"üéØ","title":"Our Mission","description":"To provide affordable, reliable, and high-quality IPTV services that empower people to enjoy unlimited entertainment on their terms.
